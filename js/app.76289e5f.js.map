這套系統能夠計算出誰改過什麼資料，也可以保留紀錄的最後版本，甚至可以將金融合約文字轉化為編碼軟體，快速傳送到另一個人手上，再經由專屬驗證碼，解開資料。這項追蹤傳輸技術過去比較常見於金融業，如今被應用在不同產業的資訊運用上。\n                        在展示 IBM 設計的測試版本時，亞納斯在網站首頁輸入了一個密碼，大概兩秒鐘，就跑出如下資訊：芒果片，10 盎司（約 310 公克）；4 月 24 日從墨西哥南部瓦哈卡的一處果園採收；一天後，以熱水處理，消滅潛在蟲卵。4 月 27 日，進口商收到貨物；再過幾天，通過海關和邊境保護局，進入美國加工廠；5 月 1 日完成切片。最後，芒果送到洛杉磯的一個冷藏倉庫，再運到沃爾瑪的店面。\n                        試想，如果食品真的受大腸桿菌或沙門氏菌污染，2 秒和 6 天的差距有多大。\n                        其他產業也嘗試用區塊鏈的技術來追蹤商品，像是丹麥航運巨頭馬士基（Maersk）已經展開測試，用來追蹤出貨的詳細情況；法國飛機製造商空中巴士（Airbus）也嘗試用以監測複雜的飛機組成零件資料。\n                        對於區塊鏈技術的前景，現任 Google 副總裁文．賽夫（Vint Cherf）認為，這項技術能否「改變世界」有待觀察，但最起碼能讓系統中的所有都處於「已知的狀態」，較容易評估可靠性和信賴度。\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div :class=\"$style.divReference\">\n                        <div
